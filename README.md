# Connect 4 Game 🎮

This project is an implementation of the classic **Connect 4** game using **Next.js**. Two players take turns dropping tokens into a 7x6 grid, and the first to connect four tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
